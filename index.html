		<p>Vergil’s transformation into the Alpha and the Omega in Devil May Cry 5 represents the ultimate evolution of his character, bridging the gap between his role as the series’ first major antagonist and its final thematic conclusion. This title, derived from the Greek alphabet to signify "the beginning and the end," mirrors his journey of self-shattering and eventual rebirth. By reuniting his human side (V) and his demonic power (Urizen), Vergil transcends his previous limitations to become a singular, absolute force of nature. His coolness is defined by this cold, disciplined pursuit of power, embodied in his Concentration-based combat style and the surgical precision of the dimension-clearing Yamato. Accompanied by the thunderous intensity of his theme, "Bury the Light," Vergil doesn't just act as a rival; he serves as the definitive benchmark of skill, standing as both the source of the Sparda bloodline's conflict and its final, most powerful resolution.</p>
